Simple supermarket for a Reevoo tech test

= How does it works

Set your rules in a Ruby array, at the moment there are two type of rules:

1. Buy-one-get-one-free

  {
    :type => 'buyonegetonefree',
    :product_code => 'code'
  }

2. Bulk Purchase

  {
    :type => 'bulkpurchase',
    :product_code => 'code',
    :items => minimum_items_number,
    :price => new_price
  }

Example:

  rules =
   [
     {
       :type => 'buyonegetonefree',
       :product_code => 'FR1'
     },
     {
       :type => 'bulkpurchase',
       :product_code => 'SR1',
       :items => 3,
       :price => 4.50
     }
   ]
 
  co = Checkout.new (rules)
  co.scan ('SR1')
  puts co.total

= Use

Install it as a gem 

  gem install supermarket-0.0.0.gem

You need a JSON file with your products, for instance
I provide a sample file with the data required for this tech
test:

  products.json

You will find a demo in the sample app I provide:

  ruby -I. supermarket.rb

= Tests

Tests are build on RSpec framework, just do:

  rspec spec
